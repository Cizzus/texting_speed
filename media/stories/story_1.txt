In the heart of an ancient forest, a young girl named Lila stumbled upon a hidden path.
As she ventured deeper, she discovered a clearing where the trees glowed with a soft, magical light.
In the center stood an enormous oak with a door carved into its trunk.
Curiosity piqued, Lila knocked, and the door creaked open to reveal a room filled with shimmering, golden leaves.
An old, wise fairy appeared and gifted Lila a single leaf, telling her it held the power to grant one wish.
Lila wished for her village to prosper, and as she returned home, she found the crops flourishing and everyone in good health.
The enchanted forest had blessed them all.
